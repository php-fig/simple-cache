PHP FIG Simple Cache PSR
========================

This repository holds all interfaces related to PSR-16.

Note that this is not an cache implementation of its own. It is merely an interface that describes an cache implementation. See the specification for more details.

You can find implementations of the spec by looking for packages providing the [psr/simple-cache-implementation](https://packagist.org/providers/psr/simple-cache-implementation) virtual package.
